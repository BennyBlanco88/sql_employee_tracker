# Project Title

SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

This application allows the user to easily access the employee database and browse through the information while having command-line functionality to add and update the employee database. Through the backend development of Node and 4 packages, users can securely access all employee's data with some command-line functionality.

## Getting Started

To use this application you first need to install all dependencies by navigating to the root folder and running

npm install

We then need to create and populate the database with information.

After navigating to the 'db' folder and logging in to mysql we do this by using

source schema.sql

and

source seeds.sql

Finally to initiate the application, we return to the root folder and use the command

node index.js


### Dependencies

This application leverages Node.js (v16.19.1), JavaScript, and SQL to operate. It makes use of several dependencies from the node package manager (npm), including sequelize (v6.31.0), mysql2 (v3.2.4), dotenv (v16.0.3), inquirer (v8.2.4), and chalk (v5.2.0).
